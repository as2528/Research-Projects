# Research Projects

This repository collects a diverse set of independent research projects spanning applied machine learning, optimization, data visualization, and utilities. Each project is self-contained and documented within its own folder.

## Project Categories

### ðŸ”¹ Applied AI

* **AI-Tutor-Simulation** â€“ Reinforcement learning environment for tutoring simulations.
* **Solving-Wordle-with-Actor-Critic-Methods** â€“ Applying actorâ€“critic reinforcement learning methods to the Wordle puzzle.

### ðŸ”¹ Data Visualization

* **Human-Atlas-Clustering-Methods** â€“ Experiments with clustering (DPGMM, UMAP) for human atlas datasets.

### ðŸ”¹ Optimization

* **Lagrange-Optimized-Protein-Folding-Code** â€“ Protein folding modeled with Lagrangian optimization techniques.
* **Scout-Meta-optimizer** â€“ Experimental meta-optimizer exploring optimization strategies.

### ðŸ”¹ Utilities

* **Scraper** â€“ Web scraper for biochemistry databases.
* **Second-MAFFT** â€“ Modified version of MAFFT alignment tool with updates.
* **Dashboard** â€“ A no code Neural Network constructing dashboard.

## Structure

Each top-level folder corresponds to a research area:

```
Applied-AI/
Data-Visualization/
Optimization/
Utilities/
```

Inside each folder, projects include Jupyter notebooks, documentation, and supporting code.
